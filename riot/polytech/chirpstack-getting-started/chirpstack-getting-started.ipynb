    "## Getting started with LoRaWAN on IoT-LAB using RIOT\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this notebook is to discover the basics of LoRaWAN communication using RIOT and ChirpStack (CampusIoT) As LoRaWAN network provider.\n",
    "This Notebook is divided in several steps:\n",
    "1. The first step requires you to configure a LoRaWAN application with one device on the ChirpStack backend\n",
    "1. You will then build and flash a RIOT application that provides a shell to control the LoRaWAN stack. On the board, you will configure the identifiers and keys required for Over-The-Air Activation (OTAA).\n",
    "1. In the last step of this tutorial, you will exchange messages between the board and ChirpStack.\n",
    "\n",
    "### LoRaWAN overview\n",
    "\n",
    "A LoRaWAN network includes a set of subsystems and protocols allowing _end-devices_ to communicate on long distances while consuming little energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "To communicate by radio, LoRaWAN devices and gateways use the LoRa radio technology. This technology is based on a Chirp Spreading Spectrum frequency modulation within public radio frequency bands (ISM). The access to the physical layer is regulated and depends on the region of use.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, LoRaWAN defines the notion of \"datarate\". A datarate index is the combination of a spreading factor (SF) and a bandwidth (BW), as shown in the table below:\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure style=\"text-align:center\">\n",
    "    <img src=\"images/lorawan-datarate-table.png\" width=\"650\" align=\"center\"/><br/><br/>\n",
    "    <figcaption><em>LoRaWAN Datarate table for EU868 band</em></figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "A datarate of 0 uses a spreading factor of 12 and a bandwidth of 125kHz, in this case the transmission is the slowest (250 bit/s). A datarate of 6 uses a spreading factor of 7 and a bandwidth of 250kHz, the transmission is the fastest in this case (11kbit/s).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find more information on LoRaWAN [here](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/LoRaWAN) and [here](https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/eccc1a_20fe760334f84a9788c5b11820281bd0.pdf):\n",
    "\n",
    "On IoT-LAB, the EU868 ISM band is used by the boards, because they are all located in Europe and the boards can only transmit on this band.\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure style=\"text-align:center\">\n",
    "    <img src=\"images/lorawan-classes.jpg\" width=\"640\" align=\"center\"/><br/><br/>\n",
    "    <figcaption><em>The LoRaWAN stack</em></figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "The LoRaWAN specifications define 3 classes of end-devices: A, B, C. Each of which has specific access to the physical layer. For more details, please refer to the LoRa specifications provided by the LoRa Alliance [here](https://www.lora-alliance.org/lorawan-for-developers).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a global overview of a LoRaWAN network:\n",

    "    <figcaption><em>The LoRaWAN infrastructure</em></figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "End devices use LoRa modulation to communicate with the gateways, which themselves use the regular Internet protocols to communicate with the LoRaWAN server, owned by a provider.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ChirpStack\n",
    "ChirpStack is an open-source LoRaWAN network server stack. Differently than ChirpStack\n",
    "its not a publicly built network. Gateway communicate with a privately hosted\n",
    "network server that de-duplicates data and the forwards it to the Application\n",
    "server. See [ChirpStack architecture](https://www.chirpstack.io/project/architecture/)\n",
    "for more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Configure a ChirpStack application\n",
    "\n",
    "Before using the LoRa devices, you have to create an account and register an\n",
    "application with a device configured on ChirpStack.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If you donâ€™t already have a ChirpStack account, ask your server provider for\n",
    "one.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Connect to the [Campus IoT Server](https://lns.campusiot.imag.fr/#/logink) and\n",
    "register your endpoint with the name `LORA_E5_DEV_XXXX_YYYY` in the application\n",
    "[**IESEG_ALARM_GZ**](https://lns.campusiot.imag.fr/#/organizations/22/applications),\n",
    "`Z` matching your group number, `XXXX` are the 4 last characters of the board `DevEUI`\n",
    "and `YYYY` are the the initials of each group member. The device profile can be changed\n",
    "later, but select `OTAA_CLASS_A_NONE` for starters.\n",
