    "## Autonomously send real sensor values to TTN\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prerequisites:** You must have followed the [getting started with TTN notebook](../ttn-getting-started/ttn-getting-started.ipynb) before starting this one.\n",
    "\n",
    "> We also consider that the application id is **iotlab-lorawan** and the device id is **iotlab-node** but you'll have to use the ids corresponding to your application and device configured in TTN.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you will write an autonomous LoRaWAN application with the following specifications:\n",
    "- The application automatically connects to TTN at startup using the OTAA activation and a datarate index of 5\n",
    "- In case of an activation issue, an error message is printed to the console and the application returns\n",
    "- A message is printed to the console to confirm the success of the activation\n",
    "- A message is sent periodically (check the duty cycle!) to the TTN backend. This message will first contain a basic string and in a second phase, it will contain the values measured on the temperature and humidity sensors.\n",
    "- A message is printed to the console each time the message is sent with success.\n",
    "\n",
    "We provide a starting RIOT application with a [Makefile](Makefile) and a [main.c](./main.c). The [Makefile](Makefile) is already configured but you will have to edit the [main.c](./main.c) by following the instructions of this Notebook.\n",

    "\n",
    "Before we start coding the application, we need to change how the data is displayed in the **Live Data** tab of your TTN application.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can change this format of the payload used to display the content of an uplink message in the `Payload formatters>Uplink` tab:\n",

    "```mk\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "2. Add the necessary includes under the comment `/* Add necessary include here */`:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "#include \"net/loramac.h\"     /* core loramac definitions */\n",
    "#include \"semtech_loramac.h\" /* package API */\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Declare the global descriptor for the loramac stack:\n",

    "semtech_loramac_t loramac;  /* The loramac stack descriptor */\n",
    "```\n",

    "**note:** in the device overview on TTN, it's possible to switch the representation of the EUIs and key from an hexadecimal representation (the default) to a C byte array representation (the one that interests us here): use the `<>` button to switch from one to the other and keep the MSB order.\n",
    "\n",

    "```c\n",
    "    semtech_loramac_set_dr(&loramac, 5);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Add the logic to join the network using the OTAA activation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "    if (semtech_loramac_join(&loramac, LORAMAC_JOIN_OTAA) != SEMTECH_LORAMAC_JOIN_SUCCEEDED) {\n",

    "    }\n",
    "    puts(\"Join procedure succeeded\");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Finally, in the `while` loop (under the comment `/* send the message here */`), send the message or continue if the message couldn't be sent:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "        if (semtech_loramac_send(&loramac,\n",
    "                                 (uint8_t *)message, strlen(message)) != SEMTECH_LORAMAC_TX_DONE) {\n",

    "        }\n",

    "\n",

    "        return 1;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Finally, add the following code at the beginning of the `while` loop to read the sensor data. You can also delete the line `char *message = \"This is RIOT!\"`\n",
    "which is now useless:\n",

    "```c\n",
    "        /* do some measurements */\n",
    "        int temperature = 0;\n",
